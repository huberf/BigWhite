# Share Board Club (previously Big White Tech)

Ever needed to share your email with someone but didn't have paper handy, and no
text field large enough for visibility. This started as a text box that you
could type any text into at 120pt, but quickly morphed into a system with real
time syncing. I've used this extensively while giving classes, as I can quickly
post links to a private board and the class can all type and contribute as I
wish.
